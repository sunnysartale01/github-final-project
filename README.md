# Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a Bash script (`simple-interest.sh`) to calculate **Simple Interest** based on user input. It is part of the GitHub Final Project hands-on labs.

---

## 📌 Purpose
The calculator helps users quickly compute simple interest using the formula:

SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Code

Where:
- **Principal (P)** → The initial amount of money.
- **Rate (R)** → The annual rate of interest (in %).
- **Time (T)** → The time period in years.

---

## ⚙️ Usage
Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
bash simple-interest.sh
You will be prompted to enter:

Principal amount

Rate of interest (annual %)

Time period (in years)

🧮 Example Run
Code
Enter Principal: 1000
Enter Rate of Interest: 5
Enter Time (in years): 2
Simple Interest = 100
