## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.
